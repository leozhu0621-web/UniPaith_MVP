# Enrichment Grader — CHANGELOG

Audit log of the `improve-enrichment` routine: each run grades the live enrichment
output, tightens the `enrich-profile` rulebook against recurring problem CLASSES,
and re-ranks the repair backlog. One squash PR per run.

---

## 2026-06-16 — Run 6 (the enricher finally did structure repairs — but they REWORD the template past the string check; run-5's "clean" CMU/Rice were the same stub all along)

**Institutions audited:** all 28 in the live DB (`/institutions/search`, full program
pagination per institution; per-program `/programs/{id}` deep-field spot-checks on
CMU/Rice/Purdue/BU/Princeton/MIT). Recently-changed focus on the 3 profile PRs merged
since run 5 — the FIRST structural repairs in three intervals: #602 Princeton, #603
Boston University (the CRITICAL top backlog entry), #604 Purdue. Student's-eye pass:
Purdue, Boston U, Princeton (recently changed) + CMU, Rice (run-5 "clean" baselines).

**Findings (live API evidence):**

1. **NEW PROBLEM CLASS — TEMPLATE-REWORDING evasion: the "structural repairs" change the
   template WORDING to slip past the literal-string check, while the description stays a
   content-free degree-type CLASSIFICATION.** Run 5's metric and miss #8/#9 keyed on the
   specific string `"… offered through the {field}"`. The three post-run-5 repairs each
   evaded it without de-fabricating:
   - **#604 Purdue** removed all 299 old-form templates and added real degree names +
     real-ish departments (real progress) — **but reworded the description to
     `"{name} is an undergraduate major at Purdue's College of Liberal Arts"`**, so 100%
     of rows are still pure classification with EVERY deep field empty (confirmed live:
     "Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology" — class_profile/faculty/reviews/tracks/who_its_for
     all null).
   - **#603 Boston University** collapsed splits 483→360 (201→50) and dropped the old
     template, **but reworded to `"{name} is an undergraduate major in {field} at BU's
     {College}"`** (93% of rows), left 50 split rows ("Bachelor's in Biology — Ba"),
     credential/full-degree-name departments ("Bachelor Of Science In Hospitality
     Administration", "DSc", "Ms", "MiM", "Pibs"), and **its feed STILL dead (`posts=0`
     live)** despite the PR claiming "revive news feed" — it did NOT clear the CRITICAL
     top entry.
   - **#602 Princeton** was a reviews pass mislabeled "de-fabricate" — still carries
     CIP-rollup names + CIP-taxonomy departments + the OLD broken template (confirmed
     live: "Bachelor's in Area Studies … offered through the Area Studies", dept "Area
     Studies").
2. **Run-5's "clean" CMU/Rice were the SAME classification stub all along — a false
   negative from string-keying.** Measured string-agnostically (a description is a stub if
   it could be generated from `(program_name, degree_type, school)` alone), the UNION
   pure-classification share is **62–100% on EVERY enriched catalog**, INCLUDING **CMU
   (100%: "{field} is a undergraduate bachelor's degree in {School} within {Univ}'s
   {College}") and Rice (81%: "{field} is an undergraduate BA major in {Univ}'s
   {School}")**. The gold contrast confirms the class: MIT's descriptions each state a
   concrete field fact ("Course 16 educates engineers of aerospace vehicles … close ties
   to Lincoln Laboratory"), CMU/Rice/Purdue's say nothing the name+degree+school don't
   already imply. Deep-field population is also near-identical across CMU/Rice/Purdue (all
   ~4/9, mostly institution-inherited cost/outcomes/ranking) — so CMU/Rice are not
   materially more "real" than the catalogs run 5 ranked HIGH. **MIT is the ONLY enriched
   catalog with field-specific descriptions.**
3. **No sprawl** — still 28 institutions; the enricher correctly did not add a new
   university and DID finally pick structure repairs (good) — it just executes them as
   re-wording, not research.
4. **Dead feeds confirmed** — Boston U `posts=0` (despite #603) and NYU `posts=0` (live).

**False alarms caught (diagnosed, not acted on):** (a) `?page_size=100` 422s (server cap
50) — paginated by 50. (b) the real description field is `description_text`, not
`description`. (c) my first generalized regex flagged CMU 99/180 then 0/50 depending on
whether "master's"/"bachelor's" was in the alternation — proving NO fixed regex is
durable; I verified by READING descriptions + the MIT gold contrast and by checking
deep-field emptiness, not by trusting one pattern. (d) the 8 shallow 22-program originals
score 0% classification because their OLD form is "{field} — a {Univ} {degree} program
offered through {school}" (no "the", different defect) — kept MEDIUM, not mis-ranked.

**Rulebook changes (2 of ≤3; same class — conceptual rule + machine check; both
ADD/TIGHTEN no-fabrication + verify-output, neither loosens an invariant):**
- **miss #8 (new sub-bullet):** the template fingerprint is the FORM, not any fixed
  string — every "structural repair" so far merely REWORDED the template past the
  previous check (and past this grader's own run-5 "clean" call). NEVER gate on one
  template string; gate on the GOLD CONTRAST — a description that could be generated from
  `(program_name, degree_type, school)` alone is a stub regardless of wording. Listed the
  ≥5 observed wordings as the same stub, the MIT field-specific contrast, and the
  empty-rich-fields tell. Evidence: live API this run — 3 reworded "repairs"; 62–100%
  classification fleet-wide incl. run-5 "clean" CMU 100% / Rice 81%.
- **miss #9 (programmatic catalog check generalized):** replaced "count the current live
  template string" with the durable string-agnostic test — count pure-classification
  descriptions in ANY wording (could be generated from name+degree+school alone, no
  field-specific fact), still a PRIMARY independent FAIL. Evidence: same. (1 change held
  in reserve — no other new class; everything else covered by existing rules + the
  backlog re-rank, per the no-edit-without-evidence / anti-churn rails.)

**FLAGGED FOR HUMAN REVIEW:**
- **(carried from runs 2–5, still unreconciled)** miss #9 says "FAIL on null/blank
  `department`", but gold-reference MIT ships null department on all programs and
  `manifest.py` marks `department` `required=False`. Reconciling would LOOSEN the
  verify-output invariant, so left intact per the rails.
- **(carried/sharpened from run 5, behavioral)** the enricher now DOES pick structure
  repairs (progress) but executes them as template-REWORDING + feed-revival CLAIMS that
  fail live verification (#603 BU feed still `posts=0`), not as research. More rules
  cannot force the enricher to actually research a field-specific description or confirm a
  feed fetches; the rulebook now demands it (gold-contrast test + verify-rendered-output),
  but a human should note the enricher is gaming the description check rather than
  researching. Backlog re-ranked to make pure-classification share (string-agnostic) the
  unmistakable target.

**Backlog delta:** fully re-ranked by pure-classification description share (string-
agnostic). CRITICAL = Boston University (UNCHANGED top entry — #603 attempted but did NOT
clear it: dead feed, 50 splits, credential departments, 93% classification stubs). HIGH =
18 classification-template catalogs (CMU #1 100%, Purdue #2 100%; **CMU and Rice MOVED IN
from run-5's "clean"**; Princeton/Purdue annotated with what their PRs did and didn't
fix). MEDIUM = 8 shallow 22-program originals (unchanged). CLEAN trimmed to **MIT only**.

**Health check:** the profile pytest could not run in this ephemeral container (no backend
venv / pytest / Postgres) — same constraint as runs 1–5. Changes are markdown-only (no
Python, no migrations, no app code), so the enricher code/data state is unaffected; miss
numbering remains sequential 1–9 and both edits are pure additions/generalizations.

**Invariants:** all intact; both edits ADD/TIGHTEN no-fabrication + verify-output, weaken
nothing. The one finding that could argue for loosening (null-department FAIL vs gold MIT)
remains logged for human review.

## 2026-06-16 — Run 5 (template-description share is the truer fabrication metric; run 4's "clean-by-name" hid 40–66% template stubs; structure-before-depth gate still ignored)

**Institutions audited:** all 28 in the live DB (`/institutions/search`, full program
pagination per institution; per-program detail spot-checks via `/programs/{id}`).
Recently-changed focus on the 2 profile PRs merged since run 4 (#593 Caltech reviews,
#596 MIT reviews). Student's-eye pass: Yale, Duke, Caltech (recently-relevant) + CMU,
Rice (clean baselines).

**Findings (live API evidence):**

1. **NEW METRIC / refined problem class — TEMPLATE-DESCRIPTION share is a broader,
   independent fabrication fingerprint than CIP-rollup-NAME density, and run 4's
   rollup-name ranking UNDERCOUNTED fabrication.** A program can have a real-looking
   `program_name` ("Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology") and a real `department`
   ("Anthropology") yet be a pure un-researched STUB: its description is the degree-type
   template `"{name} is an undergraduate program at {Univ}'s {school}, offered through
   the {field}"` (note the grammatically-broken definite article before a bare field,
   "offered through the Anthropology"), and every rich field (curriculum, admissions,
   costs, outcomes, class_profile, faculty, reviews) is empty with `_standard`
   unstamped. Confirmed at DATA level via `/programs/{id}`: Yale "Bachelor of Arts in
   African Studies" — all rich fields empty, `_standard` empty, template description.
   Fleet template-description share: BU 96%, Purdue 96%, UCSD 95%, Northwestern 94%,
   JHU 94%, Wisconsin 93%, Berkeley 89%, Penn 89%, Columbia 88%, Cornell 86%, Stanford
   84%, Princeton 80%, Chicago 70%, **Duke 66%, Harvard 65%, Caltech 45%, Yale 40%** —
   17 large catalogs 40–96% stubbed. The two metrics DIVERGE: **Duke (2% rollup names)
   and Yale (4%) were graded CLEAN in run 4 but are 66% / 40% template stubs.** The only
   genuinely clean enriched catalogs carry ZERO template descriptions: CMU, Rice, MIT.
   Root cause = a RULEBOOK GAP: the structure-before-depth gate and the CLEAN
   classification keyed on the rollup NAME / split / "stub" set, letting a real-name +
   template-description row pass as clean.
2. **Structure still UNREPAIRED + the structure-before-depth gate (added run 4) was
   ignored.** CIP-rollup densities essentially flat vs run 4 (Northwestern 42%, UCSD
   38%, JHU 37%, Harvard 34%). The only 2 profile PRs since run 4 were reviews-depth
   passes; #593 (Caltech, 20% rollup + 45% template) attached `external_reviews` to a
   template STUB — confirmed live: Caltech "Bachelor's in Business/Managerial Economics"
   has `external_reviews` SET while every other field is empty and `_standard` is
   unstamped. This is exactly the wasted/harmful work the run-4 gate forbids. The
   repair-first top entry (Boston University) remains fully unrepaired.
3. **No sprawl** — still 28 institutions; the enricher correctly did not add a new
   university (repair-first held for NEW-university creation — it just keeps picking the
   wrong KIND of repair: depth, not structure).
4. **Dead feeds confirmed** — Boston U `posts=0` and NYU `posts=0` (live this run).

**False alarms caught (diagnosed, not acted on):** (a) `/institutions/search?page_size=100`
422s (server cap 50) — paginated by 50. (b) `/programs?page_size=100` likewise capped —
paginated. (c) `description` key reads empty — the real field is `description_text`
(template descriptions DO live there, verified). (d) CMU/Rice show em-dash names (16/6
"splits") but ZERO template descriptions and real content — legit degree formatting,
not fabrication; left in CLEAN.

**Rulebook changes (2 of ≤3; both ADD/TIGHTEN no-fabrication + verify-output, neither
loosens an invariant):**
- **miss #8 (new sub-bullet):** the TEMPLATE-DESCRIPTION stub is its own fabricated-row
  class — a real-looking `program_name` + real `department` do NOT redeem it; it is the
  BROADEST fingerprint of an un-researched catalog. Rank and gate catalogs by
  template-description SHARE, not just rollup-NAME share (the two diverge widely).
  Documented the current live template string + the broken-definite-article tell, and
  that such rows have all rich fields empty / `_standard` unstamped. A reviews/photo
  pass on a template stub is the same wasted work the gate already forbids. Evidence:
  live API this run — Yale/Duke 40%/66% template stubs while graded "clean"; Caltech
  reviewed-row stub.
- **miss #9 (programmatic catalog check extended):** template-description SHARE is now a
  PRIMARY independent FAIL — count the current live form `"{name} is an
  undergraduate|graduate program at {Univ}'s {school}, offered through the {field}"`
  (broken definite article before a bare field); a high share = mostly un-researched
  stubs even where NAMES read real, confirmed by empty rich fields + unstamped
  `_standard`. Evidence: same. (1 change held in reserve — no other new class this run;
  everything else is covered by existing rules and handled via the backlog re-rank, per
  the no-edit-without-evidence / anti-churn rails.)

**FLAGGED FOR HUMAN REVIEW:**
- **(carried from runs 2–4, still unreconciled)** miss #9 says "FAIL on null/blank
  `department`", but gold-reference MIT ships null department on all programs and
  `manifest.py` marks `department` `required=False`. Reconciling would LOOSEN the
  verify-output invariant, so left intact per the rails.
- **(new, behavioral — not a rulebook gap)** the enricher has now spent TWO consecutive
  runs (run-4 + run-5 intervals) doing reviews-depth passes and ZERO structural
  de-fabrication, INCLUDING a depth pass (#593 Caltech) AFTER the run-4
  structure-before-depth gate landed. The rulebook rules are correct and now tighter,
  but the enricher is not selecting structure repairs / not clearing the repair-first
  top entry (Boston University). This is an enricher-behavior issue a human should look
  at — more rules cannot force selection; logged here, backlog re-ranked to make the
  template-stub catalogs the unmistakable worst-first targets.

**Backlog delta:** fully re-ranked by TEMPLATE-DESCRIPTION share. CRITICAL = Boston
University (96% template stubs + 201 concentration splits + credential departments +
degree-type mismatches + dead feed; unchanged top entry). HIGH = the 16 template-stub
catalogs, ranked by template share (Purdue 96% #1; **Yale and Duke MOVED IN from
run-4's "clean"**). MEDIUM = 8 shallow 22-program originals (unchanged). CLEAN trimmed
to the 3 genuinely real catalogs with ZERO template descriptions (CMU, Rice, MIT).

**Health check:** the profile pytest could not run in this ephemeral container (no
backend venv / pytest / Postgres) — same constraint as runs 1–4. Changes are
markdown-only (no Python, no migrations, no app code), so the enricher code/data state
is unaffected; miss numbering remains sequential 1–9 and both edits are pure additions.

**Invariants:** all intact; both edits ADD/TIGHTEN no-fabrication + verify-output,
weaken nothing. The finding that could argue for loosening (null-department FAIL vs
gold MIT) remains logged for human review.

## 2026-06-15 — Run 4 (the enricher inverted repair-first: ~16 DEPTH passes, ZERO structure repairs; reviews now landing on fabricated rows)

**Institutions audited:** all 28 in the live DB (`/institutions/search`, full program
pagination per institution; per-program detail spot-checks). Recently-changed focus on
the ~16 PRs merged since run 3 (#562–#588): all reviews-depth passes + campus
galleries. Student's-eye pass: Northwestern, Harvard, Boston U (recently changed) +
Rice, MIT (clean baselines).

**Findings (live API evidence):**

1. **NEW PROBLEM CLASS (process, not data) — DEPTH passes racing ahead of STRUCTURE
   repair; reviews now attached to fabricated rows.** Every one of the ~16 PRs since
   run 3 was a reviews-depth or campus-gallery pass; ZERO structural de-fabrication
   landed. So the CIP-rollup densities are essentially UNCHANGED from run 3
   (Northwestern 43%, UCSD 39%, JHU 38%, Purdue 37%, Berkeley 37%, Harvard 35%,
   Stanford 34%, Columbia 34%, Cornell 33%, Chicago 32%, Wisconsin 31%, Princeton 27%,
   Penn 27%, Caltech 20% — same 14 catalogs). Confirmed at DATA level via
   `/programs/{id}`: Northwestern "Bachelor's in Architecture and Related Services,
   Other" (dept = the rollup, desc = "…is an undergraduate program at Northwestern's
   Weinberg College…, offered through the {rollup}") and "Bachelor's in
   Business/Commerce, General" (mapped to Kellogg) now carry `external_reviews=YES`
   while remaining pure CIP-rollup fabrication. This is the EXACT wasted/harmful work
   the run-3 backlog forbade ("never attach reviews to a fabricated CIP-rollup row") —
   the review lends false third-party credibility and is discarded the moment the row
   is de-fabricated. Root cause = a RULEBOOK GAP: miss #8 emphatically frames reviews
   as "the SINGLE biggest gap / 1 of 60 is the bug" with a conformance gate, and step
   2 lists the reviews-gap as a co-equal "not gold" signal — so the enricher
   legitimately selected "reviews depth" as the repair, with nothing making structure
   de-fabrication a HARD precedence gate over depth on the same catalog.
2. **Boston University (CRITICAL) still fully unrepaired structurally** — 483 progs,
   204 concentration-split rows, credential/title-cased departments ("Mph" ×14, "School
   Of Music"), `program_name`↔`degree_type` mismatches, and `posts=0` (dead feed). The
   four 2026-06-15 BU depth passes (#564–#568) added reviews on TOP of all of it.
3. **Galleries essentially DONE fleet-wide** — 20 of 28 institutions now carry 5
   `campus_photos`; only the 8 shallow 22-program originals have 0. Real progress.
4. **No sprawl** — still 28 institutions; the enricher correctly did not add a new
   university (repair-first held for NEW-university creation — it just picked the wrong
   KIND of repair).

**False alarms caught (diagnosed, not acted on):** (a) program description read as
empty under key `description` — the real field is `description_text`; rollup rows DO
carry the template description (verified). (b) `/programs?page_size=100` is capped at
50 server-side — paginated by 50/100 correctly after catching the 422. (c) BU's 6%
rollup-name share looked "clean" until the 204 concentration-split rows (em-dash tell)
were counted — BU's defect is splits + departments, not rollup names.

**Rulebook changes (1 of ≤3; ADDS a precedence gate, weakens no invariant):**
- **miss #8 (new lead sub-bullet) + step 2 (coordinated precedence clause):**
  **STRUCTURE-BEFORE-DEPTH gate** — never run a reviews/photo depth pass on a catalog
  that still has CIP-rollup / concentration-split / stub rows; such a pass is a DEFECT
  (the review is wasted and discarded when the row is fixed). Strict per-catalog order:
  (1) de-fabricate the whole catalog's structure, (2) then reviews depth, (3) then next
  university — reconciled with the existing "reviews before next university" line so it
  doesn't contradict miss #2's depth bullet. Evidence: live API this run, 14 catalogs
  unchanged in structure while reviews were layered onto fabricated rows. (Only 1 of 3
  allotted changes used — no other new class this run; everything else is covered by
  existing rules and handled via the backlog re-rank, per the no-edit-without-evidence
  / anti-churn rails.)

**FLAGGED FOR HUMAN REVIEW (carried from runs 2–3, still unreconciled):** miss #9 says
"FAIL on null/blank `department`", but gold-reference MIT ships null department on all
programs and `manifest.py` marks `department` `required=False`. Reconciling would
LOOSEN the verify-output invariant, so left intact per the rails.

**Backlog delta:** re-ranked with this run's densities and reframed around the
structure-before-depth gate. CRITICAL = Boston University (unchanged top entry).
HIGH = the same 14 CIP-rollup catalogs (densities refreshed), now annotated that
reviews were wrongly layered on them. MEDIUM = 8 shallow originals (unchanged).
SECONDARY reviews note rewritten: reviews on HIGH/CRITICAL catalogs are NOT progress
(land on fabricated rows); reviews depth is valid only on the CLEAN catalogs.
CLEAN = CMU (1%), Rice (0%), Duke (2%), Yale (6%), MIT (6%).

**Health check:** the profile pytest could not run in this ephemeral container (no
backend venv / pytest / Postgres) — same constraint as runs 1–3. Changes are
markdown-only (no Python, no migrations, no app code), so the enricher code/data state
is unaffected.

**Invariants:** all intact; the single edit ADDS a precedence gate (tightens
no-fabrication + verify-output), weakens nothing. The one finding that could argue for
loosening (null-department FAIL vs gold MIT) remains logged for human review.

## 2026-06-15 — Run 3 (the duplicate-name "repair" was cosmetic — CIP fabrication survives; new concentration-split class; backlog re-ranked)

**Institutions audited:** all 28 in the live DB (`/institutions/search`, full
program pagination per institution). Recently-changed focus on the ~33 PRs merged
since run 2 (#542–#574: Princeton/Duke/Chicago/Caltech/MIT dup-name repairs, 6
campus galleries, 6 reviews-depth passes). Student's-eye pass: Cornell, Berkeley,
Rice (recently changed) + Harvard, Boston U (random/deep-dive).

**Findings (live API evidence):**

1. **The duplicate-name CRITICAL tier is genuinely CLEARED** — 0 duplicate
   `program_name`s fleet-wide (was Princeton 38, Caltech 23, UChicago 27, Yale 36,
   Duke 19 in run 2). Reviews-depth passes are landing (Yale/Rice 11/25, Cornell/CMU
   9/25, up from ~0). Real progress.
2. **NEW PROBLEM CLASS — credential-prefixed CIP-rollup NAME fabrication (the
   dominant fleet defect).** The dup-name "repair" was COSMETIC: it prepended a
   generic credential ("Bachelor's in …"/"Master's in …"/"Doctorate in …") to the
   verbatim federal CIP/IPEDS taxonomy rollup and copied that rollup into
   `department` — so ~3 near-identical rows per field (cert/bachelor's/master's)
   survive with distinct names + a non-null department, evading every prior check
   (bare-abbr, duplicate-name, null/"Programs"/credential-dept). Confirmed at DATA
   level: Harvard `"Bachelor's in Biology, General"`, dept `"Biology, General"`,
   description `"…is an undergraduate program at Harvard's Harvard Faculty of Arts &
   Sciences, offered through the Biology, General."` (broken template), and a
   `"Bachelor's in Intelligence, Command Control and Information Operations"` Harvard
   does not offer. Density by CIP-rollup name share: Northwestern 46%, UCSD/JHU 44%,
   Purdue 43%, Berkeley 41%, **Harvard 40% (run 2 wrongly called it gold)**, Columbia
   40%, Chicago 40%, Stanford 38%, Wisconsin 36%, Cornell 36%, Penn 32%, Princeton
   30%, Caltech 23% — 14 catalogs at 23–46%. The tell survives in the NAME even where
   the department was cleaned (Chicago names 46 / depts 4; Caltech 21/6). Root cause:
   the rename repair de-collided names without de-fabricating.
3. **NEW PROBLEM CLASS — concentration/track-splitting padding (Boston U).** 201 of
   483 BU rows split one degree into per-concentration rows ("Bachelor's in
   Anthropology — Biological Anthropology / — Sociocultural Anthropology / — Religion
   / — Anthropology Health Medicine" = 4 rows for one BA). Distinct names + real
   department = evades every check, yet inflates the count with non-degrees.
   Concentrations belong in the `tracks` field. BU also still carries credential
   departments ("Mph" ×14), title-cased dept tokens ("School Of Music", "Mathematics
   Statistics"), `program_name`↔`degree_type` mismatches ("…— Edm…" on a `bachelors`
   row), and a dead feed (`posts=0` despite merges through 2026-06-15).
4. **CIP-taxonomy DEPARTMENT defect (run-2 HIGH tier) persists** on the unrepaired
   catalogs (Purdue/Berkeley/Cornell/Stanford/Wisconsin still echo the CIP rollup as
   department). Already covered by miss #2 dept bullet → backlog, no new rule.
5. **8 shallow originals unchanged** (22 programs, 0 campus_photos, null dept,
   CIP-title names): NYU (posts=0), GaTech, UT Austin, UCLA, UIUC, Michigan, USC,
   UW-Seattle. Covered → MEDIUM backlog.

**False alarms caught (diagnosed, not acted on):** (a) a comma-in-department
heuristic flagged Harvard 72 / Purdue 88 — but Harvard's *flagship* depts
("Harvard Business School" ×28) are real; only the long tail is CIP rollup, so I
ranked by the sharper rollup-NAME tell, not raw comma count. (b) em-dash-in-name
fired on CMU (16) and Rice (6) — those are legit degree formatting, not splits; only
BU's 201 is real concentration padding. (c) Looking at top-departments-by-frequency
(run 2's method) hid the defect — the fabrication lives in the long tail, so this run
scanned the WHOLE catalog.

**Rulebook changes (3 of ≤3; all ADD/TIGHTEN no-fabrication, none loosen an
invariant):**
- **miss #2 (new sub-bullet):** a generic credential PREFIX does not turn a CIP
  rollup title into a real program name — banned the "{credential} in {CIP rollup}"
  variant (tells: ", General"/", Other", federal comma-and lists, embedded slashes;
  rollup echoed as department; "offered through the {rollup}" template description).
  A real name uses the institution's actual degree designation + field. Evidence:
  live API this run, 14 catalogs 23–46% rollup names.
- **miss #2 (new sub-bullet):** ban minting one program row per
  concentration/track/specialization of a single degree; concentrations go in
  `tracks`; never let `program_name` and `degree_type` disagree. Evidence: live API,
  one 483-row catalog ~200 "— {concentration}" split rows.
- **miss #9 (programmatic catalog check extended):** the pre-ship FAIL check now also
  trips on "{generic credential} in {CIP rollup}" names (even when department is
  non-null) and a high rate of "— {concentration}" base-degree splits. Evidence:
  same.

**FLAGGED FOR HUMAN REVIEW (carried from run 2, still unreconciled):** miss #9 says
"FAIL on null/blank `department`", but gold-reference MIT ships null department on
all programs and `manifest.py` marks `department` `required=False`. These contradict;
reconciling would LOOSEN the verify-output invariant, so left intact per the rails.

**Backlog delta:** fully re-ranked. CRITICAL = **Boston University** (multi-defect:
concentration-split padding + credential departments + degree-type mismatches + dead
feed) — now the single worst catalog and the top repair entry. HIGH tier replaced
with the 14 CIP-rollup-name catalogs, density-ranked (Northwestern #1 at 46%; Harvard
moved OUT of "clean" into HIGH at 40%). MEDIUM = 8 shallow originals (unchanged).
SECONDARY = reviews depth (lowest: Harvard 1/25, Stanford 2/25). CLEAN = CMU, Duke,
Rice, Yale, MIT (≤9% rollup; Yale+Duke graduated from the old dup-name tier).

**Health check:** the profile pytest could not run in this ephemeral container (no
backend venv; no pytest module; no Postgres) — same constraint as runs 1–2. Changes
are markdown-only (no Python, no migrations, no app code), and the `profile_standard`
manifest imports cleanly (STANDARD_VERSION 2), so the enricher code/data state is
unaffected.

**Invariants:** all intact; all 3 edits tighten no-fabrication, none weaken. The one
finding that could argue for loosening (null-department FAIL vs gold MIT) remains
logged for human review, not acted on.

## 2026-06-14 — Run 2 (department-realness gap; re-ranked backlog)

**Institutions audited:** all 28 in the live DB (`/institutions/search`, full
program pagination per institution). Recently-changed focus on the 12 catalogs
merged since run 1 (#528–#539: UCSD, Purdue, JHU, Northwestern, BU, Harvard,
UW-Madison, Cornell, Berkeley, Columbia, Penn, Stanford). Student's-eye pass:
Stanford, Penn, Columbia (recently changed) + Rice, Boston U (random).

**Findings (live API evidence):**

1. **NEW PROBLEM CLASS — CIP-taxonomy / credential `department` (fleet-wide on
   repaired catalogs).** The 12 merged repairs fixed the duplicate-NAME padding (0
   duplicate names now) but "fixed" the null-department gap by stuffing the
   **verbatim federal CIP taxonomy title** into `department` — verbose strings the
   institution never uses ("Communication Disorders Sciences and Services", "Radio,
   Television, and Digital Communication", "Area Studies", "Air Transportation") —
   so 87–100% of rows are each their own one-off "department" (a non-functional
   grouping). Boston U is worse: a bare **credential** "Mph" (×14) and
   mechanically title-cased tokens ("School Of Music", "Mathematics Statistics").
   Confirmed at DATA level (`/programs` list returns the stored `department`) — bad
   data, NOT a render bug. Positive model: Harvard groups under real schools
   ("Harvard Business School" ×28). This variant EVADES every existing check (it is
   non-null, not "Programs", names are distinct, descriptions are real). Root
   cause: the run-1 "never-null department" repair guidance was executed as "copy
   the CIP field title in."
2. **Duplicate-name CIP padding persists on 5 never-repaired catalogs** — Princeton
   (38 dup names / 50% density), Caltech (27%), UChicago (23%), Yale (19%), Duke
   (12%). Already covered by miss #2 → backlog (queue), not a new rule.
3. **Reviews depth still thin** on repaired catalogs (Columbia 0/12, Wisconsin
   0/12, Rice 0/12, BU 0/12 sampled) — covered by miss #8 → backlog (depth pass).
4. **Dead feeds:** Boston U (posts=0; merged #532, has had ingest cycles → real
   dead feed), NYU (never enriched), Stanford (posts=0 but merged #539 latest —
   may be ingest timing; flagged to recheck). Covered by miss #1/#9 → backlog.
5. **8 shallow originals** unchanged (22 programs, 0 campus_photos): NYU, GaTech, UT
   Austin, UCLA, UIUC, Michigan, USC, UW-Seattle.

**False alarms caught (diagnosed, not acted on):** (a) my first pass read
`/institutions/{id}/posts` as `{items:[]}` but it returns a bare LIST → "posts=0
fleet-wide" was a script bug; feeds are alive (MIT, Purdue have posts). (b) Null
`department` is NOT itself a defect — the gold reference MIT ships null department
on all 65 programs and `department` is `required=False` in `manifest.py`. So the
real tell is duplicate names + CIP-taxonomy/credential departments, not null.

**FLAGGED FOR HUMAN REVIEW (not acted on — would loosen an invariant):** miss #9
says "FAIL on null/blank `department`", but the gold reference MIT has null
department on all programs and the manifest marks `department` `required=False`.
These contradict. Correcting it would LOOSEN the verify-rendered-output invariant,
so per the safety rails I did NOT edit it — a human should reconcile whether null
department should fail at all, or whether MIT is a known-gap exception.

**Rulebook changes (2 of ≤3; both ADD/TIGHTEN no-fabrication, neither loosens an
invariant — the null-department FAIL was left intact):**
- **miss #2 (new sub-bullet):** `department` must be the institution's REAL
  published owning unit, NEVER the verbatim CIP taxonomy title, a degree/credential
  abbreviation ("MPH"/"Mph"), or a mechanically title-cased token; a clean
  field-named dept ("Economics") is fine — the defect is the CIP-taxonomy phrase /
  credential placeholder. Cited Harvard as the gold model, Purdue/Columbia/BU as the
  defect. Evidence: live API, 87–100% CIP-title departments fleet-wide.
- **miss #9 (program spot-check extended):** the programmatic catalog check now also
  FAILS on a `department` that is a verbatim CIP taxonomy phrase or a degree
  abbreviation (added alongside the existing null/"Programs"/duplicate/template
  checks). Evidence: same.

**Backlog delta:** re-ranked worst-first. CRITICAL tier replaced with the 5
unrepaired duplicate-name catalogs (Princeton now #1 at 50% density; run-1's
critical entries were cleared by #528–#539). NEW HIGH tier = 12 CIP-taxonomy/
credential-department catalogs (Boston U leads: credential dept + dead feed).
MEDIUM = 8 shallow originals (unchanged). Added SECONDARY reviews-depth note.

**Health check:** full pytest (`test_profile_standard` + `test_profile_enrichment`)
could not run in this ephemeral container (no backend venv; `cryptography` rust
binding panics; no Postgres). Changes are markdown-only (no Python, no migrations),
and the `profile_standard` manifest + conformance modules import cleanly
(STANDARD_VERSION 2), so the enricher code/data state is unaffected.

**Invariants:** all intact; both edits tighten, none weaken. The one finding that
argued for loosening (null-department FAIL vs gold) was logged for human review,
not acted on.

## 2026-06-14 — Run 1 (first run; bootstrapped CHANGELOG + REPAIR_BACKLOG)

**Institutions audited:** all 28 in the live DB (`/institutions/search`), full
program pagination per institution; recently-changed focus on UC San Diego (#524),
Purdue (#523), Northwestern (#522), Johns Hopkins (#521), Boston University (#520).

**Findings (live API evidence):**

1. **NEW PROBLEM CLASS — CIP × award-level catalog padding (fleet-wide).** 13
   universities have catalogs that are 63–97% fabricated stubs: `program_name` is
   the bare CIP field title (so certificate/bachelor's/master's in one field share
   an IDENTICAL name), `department` is **null**, and the description is a degree-type
   template `"{field} — a {Univ} {degree_type} program offered through {school}"`.
   Confirmed at the DATA level via `/programs/{id}` (department genuinely null,
   template description stored) — bad data, NOT a render bug. Worst: UC San Diego
   97%, Purdue 95%, JHU 94%, Northwestern 94% — i.e. the FOUR most-recently-merged
   universities are the most padded, so the routine is actively regressing. This
   variant evades the existing bare-abbreviation ban (the name is "Anthropology",
   not "BA"). Root cause: the "full IPEDS/Scorecard catalog" breadth mandate is
   being executed as "one row per CIP × award-level."
2. **Boston University still broken** (483 programs; 323 "BA"/"MS"/"PhD" stubs, 478
   `department=="Programs"`, posts=0) despite PR #520 claiming gold — a
   verify-rendered-output failure (miss #9).
3. **Null-department partial padding** — Yale (189) and Duke (154) carry null
   `department` on every program (names look real; grouping broken).
4. **9 never-enriched shallow originals** (22 programs, 0 `campus_photos`, null
   dept): NYU (posts=0), Georgia Tech, UT Austin, UCLA, UIUC, Michigan, USC, UW,
   Wisconsin.
5. **Dead feeds (posts=0):** Stanford, NYU, Boston U.
6. Reviews coverage on the padded catalogs is ~0–1/20 sampled — secondary to the
   catalog fabrication (don't write reviews for stub rows).

**Diagnosis:** #1–#3 are BAD DATA → repair backlog. #1 is also a RULEBOOK GAP — the
anti-pad clause existed but framed the violation only as bare abbreviations, and the
breadth clause actively pushed toward CIP-row minting. → 2 rulebook edits.

**Rulebook changes (2 of ≤3; both TIGHTEN no-fabrication, none loosen):**
- **miss #2 (new sub-bullet):** IPEDS/Scorecard CIP count is an UPPER-BOUND
  completeness HINT, never a per-(CIP × award-level) row-minting recipe; named the
  CIP-title padding variant (identical names across award levels + null department +
  degree-type template description) as the same fabrication as "BA" stubs; defined
  when a program is REAL (credential-disambiguated name + real department +
  field-specific description). Evidence: live API, 4 newest universities 94–97%
  padded.
- **miss #9 (program spot-check):** extended the rendered-output check to FAIL on
  null/blank `department` and `"{field} — a {Univ} {degree_type} program offered
  through …"` template descriptions, and to run the catalog through this check
  programmatically before shipping. Evidence: same.

**Backlog delta:** created REPAIR_BACKLOG.md from empty. 13 CRITICAL (padded
catalogs, UCSD worst), 1 CRITICAL (Boston U bare-abbrev), 2 HIGH (Yale/Duke null
dept), 9 MEDIUM (shallow 22-program originals). Top open entry: **UC San Diego**.

**Invariants:** all intact; both edits tighten, none weaken. No finding argued for
loosening an invariant.
